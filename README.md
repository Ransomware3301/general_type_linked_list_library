# general_type_linked_list_library
General-Type Linked List Library written in C 
<br>
The type can be choosen by setting to 1 the corresponding _define_ directive in the header file, and set to 0 all others
<br>
<br>
Currently, the supported data types are:
- char
- short int
- int
- float
- double
- long double
<br>
I'm planning to add more data types in the future if there'll be a need for this library.
